# FlappyBird
My version from classic FlappyBird game made with C++ and Qt Creator.

Start game by running the main file.

Bird "jumps" up every time space is pressed. Object is to go through pipes.
Hitting pipe or going outside of the screen ends game. All time highest score
is displayed in top of the screen.
