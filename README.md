# FlappyBird
My version of classic FlappyBird game made with C++ and Qt Creator.

Start the game by running the main file in Qt Creator.

Bird "jumps" up every time space is pressed. The object is to go through the gaps that are between the pipes.
Hitting pipe or going outside of the screen ends game. All time highest score
is displayed in top of the screen.
