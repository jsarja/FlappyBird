# FlappyBird
My version of the classic FlappyBird game made with C++ and Qt Creator.

Start the game by running the main file in Qt Creator.

Bird "jumps" up every time space is pressed. The object is to go through gaps that are between pipes.
Hitting a pipe or going outside of the screen ends the game. The all time highest score
is displayed in top of the screen.
